## Sharkfin light

Modded version of Sharkfin Stealthfin that is lighter, and no longer is "stealthy". I added cutouts, re-worked the OG Sharkfin thumb lever and added that, removed some plastic at the bottom too

I included CAD, but not STLs. I do not recommend printing this (yet), as there is probably issues.

Edit: Kayos here.  I added STLS.  Play at your own risk. :D
